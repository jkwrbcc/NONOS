## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to set up the environment, e.g. pip/conda/docker commands, download datasets, etc...

## Generate simulation data

To generate the simulation data in the paper, run this command:

```train
python generate_sim.py --exp_num 4_1_1
```

The experimental number (exp_num) corresponds to Section number in our paper.

## Training

To train the model(s) in the paper, run this command:

```train
python NONOS_train.py --input-data <path_to_data> --gpus 4 --epochs 200 --mode <simple or SpecParam> --specpara-result <path_to_result>
```

- We provide two versions of models: NONOS-simple and NONOS-SpecParam.
- For NONOS-SpecParam, a pre-calculated spectral parameterization result is required for smooth computation.


## Evaluation

To evaluate my model on ImageNet, run:

```eval
python NONOS_eval.py --model-file mymodel.checkpoint --input-data <path_to_data>
```

## Results

Our model achieves the following performance on :
